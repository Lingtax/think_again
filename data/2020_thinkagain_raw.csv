The 2nd post is a typical right-leaning white man blaming everything else but capitalism for the fall of the climate. It even unapologetically blamed  scientists while providing a cartoon as it's only source. Also some sensationalist language were also used by effectively painting the lower class as the victims of proposed changes to combat climate change, when in reality, the big companies would suffer the most under these changes and restrictions to stop climate change
